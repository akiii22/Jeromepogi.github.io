      Dear My Love,<br><br>
      I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. You have brought so much joy and love into my life and I am grateful to have you by my side. I promise to always support you, to make you laugh, and to be there for you through thick and thin. I love you now and forever.<br><br>
      Love,<br>
      Your future husband,
    </p>
